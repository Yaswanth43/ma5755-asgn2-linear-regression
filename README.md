# ma5755-asgn2-linear-regression
In this project, I analyzed and predicted stock prices using a linear regression model. I loaded synthetic data, selected relevant features, trained the model, and evaluated its performance using mean absolute error and mean squared error. Additionally, I explored individual attributes and visualized relationships with a scatterplot matrix.
